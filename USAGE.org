* How to use nexo-koinly-csv with currency exchange transactions

  0. Nexo has garbage data in the amount of sent currency in exchange transactions. You must enter the sent currency amount by hand using, gathering the amounts from https://platform.nexo.io/transactions.
  1. Download nexo-koinly-csv
  2. Download your Nexo CSV export file from https://platform.nexo.io/transactions
  3. Rename or copy the downloaded Nexo CSV export file, e.g.
     #+begin_src shell
       $ cp nexo_transactions.csv nexo_transactions_2022-04-04.csv
     #+end_src
  4. In a shell, run nexo-koinly-csv taking your CSV file as an argument. Redirect output to your filename of choice, e.g.
     #+begin_src shell
       $ perl nexo-koinly-csv nexo_transactions_2022-04-04.csv > nexo_export_220404.csv
     #+end_src
  5. Now you must edit by hand a file that nexo-koinly-csv created in the previous step.
     + The Nexo CSV export has bad data for the sent currency amount
  6. nexo-koinly-csv wrote a file 'EXCH.TXT' in step 4. Copy EXCH.TXT to a file name EXCHANGES.TXT
     #+begin_src shell
       $ cp EXCH.TXT EXCHANGES.TXT
     #+end_src
     + The content of EXCH.TXT was written by nexo-koinly-csv in step 4.
       #+begin_src shell
	 NXTy.......W2: Sent ? USDC received 5.31763788 ETH on 2022-03-23 22:26:32+01:00
	 NXT2.......Sr: Sent ? UST received 15919.48184483 USDC on 2022-03-23 22:25:06+01:00
	 NXTx.......cr: Sent ? USDC received 2.45493262 BNB on 2022-03-23 22:04:32+01:00
	 .
	 .
	 .
       #+end_src
  7. Edit EXCHANGES.TXT with the sent amounts for each currency exchange you made using https://platform.nexo.io/transactions
     + Tip: Filter "Transaction Type" to "Exchange" with the spin button at https://platform.nexo.io/transactions
     + The edited EXCHANGES.TXT file will be like
       #+begin_src shell
	 NXTy.......W2: Sent 15,999.079254 USDC received 5.31763788 ETH on 2022-03-dd 22:26:32+01:00
	 NXT2.......Sr: Sent 15,941.97006607 UST received 15919.48184483 USDC on 2022-03-dd 22:25:06+01:00
	 NXTx.......cr: Sent 1,003.816994 USDC received 2.45493262 BNB on 2022-03-dd 22:04:32+01:00
	 NXTs.......X7: Sent 1,000.00000000 UST received 998.82288 USDC on 2022-03-dd 21:57:00+01:00
       #+end_src
     + It should be apparent that you replace the ? with the correct sent currency amount.
     + It is OK to leave commas in the number but don't change any of the rest for the line.
  8. Now run nexo-koinly-csv a second time with EXCHANGES.TXT as the second arguement, e.g.
  #+begin_src shell
    $ perl nexo-koinly-csv nexo_transactions_2022-04-04.csv EXCHANGES.TXT > nexo_export_220404.csv
  #+end_src
  nexo_export_220404.csv should now have proper values for sent currency amounts.
